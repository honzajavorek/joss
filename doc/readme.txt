What is Joss?
*************

Joss is a simple web-based program, which allows you to create and administrate
your own website in a very, very simple and easy way. Too intelligent people
calls it CMS (content management system) or framework.

Joss believes if it is kind and friendly to others, they will too. Joss would
like to be a really simple and fast CMS. At the same time it is not afraid of
the latest web technologies and hopes it can restrain them to be useful and
well implemented.

Code is written in object PHP 5 and uses or plans to use technologies XML,
XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in the most upstanding way.

Thanks to all who encouraged me to the creation of Joss by releasing their
great projects as Open Source. Especially thanks to the genius David Grudl and
my friend Michal Wiglasz. Joss derive benefits from containing a code of Texy!
formatter and some parts of Nette framework.
